# Logical Clifford Synthesis for Stabilizer Codes

This repository contains implementations of algorithms for synthesizing logical Clifford operators for stabilizer codes in quantum computation. These algorithms provide a systematic framework for translating logical operations into physical quantum circuits.

## Overview of Algorithms

### Algorithm 1: Finding a Symplectic Matrix for Linear Systems
- **Purpose**: Solve a system of linear equations in the symplectic group \( Sp(2m, F_2) \) using symplectic transvections.
- **Steps**:
  1. Evaluate the symplectic inner product of row vectors to determine transformations.
  2. Apply necessary symplectic transvections for corrections.
  3. Iterate over vectors to ensure they map correctly, preserving the symplectic structure.
- **Implementation**: `algorithm_1.py`

### Algorithm 2: Enumerating All Symplectic Solutions
- **Purpose**: Enumerates all symplectic solutions for a system of linear equations by leveraging degrees of freedom in partially constrained matrices.
- **Steps**:
  1. Use **Algorithm 1** to find a particular solution to the system.
  2. Identify free vectors in the symplectic basis that can vary while maintaining valid symplectic constraints.
  3. Enumerate all combinations of free vectors to generate all solutions.
- **Implementation**: `algorithm_2.py`

### Algorithm 3: Logical Clifford Synthesis (LCS) [Under Development]
- **Purpose**: Synthesizes all physical realizations of logical Clifford operators for stabilizer codes.
- **Steps**:
  1. Translate logical Clifford operations into linear constraints on symplectic matrices.
  2. Use **Algorithm 2** to find all symplectic solutions.
  3. Translate symplectic matrices into physical quantum circuits.
- **Implementation**: Currently under development. The file will be named `algorithm_3.py`.
