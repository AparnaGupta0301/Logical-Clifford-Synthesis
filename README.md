# Logical Clifford Synthesis for Stabilizer Codes

This repository contains implementations of algorithms for synthesizing logical Clifford operators for stabilizer codes in quantum computation. These algorithms provide a systematic framework for translating logical operations into physical quantum circuits.

## Overview of Algorithms

### Algorithm 1: Finding a Symplectic Matrix for Linear Systems
- **Purpose**: Solve a system of linear equations in the symplectic group $ Sp(2m, F_2) $ using symplectic transvections.
---
### Algorithm 2: Enumerating All Symplectic Solutions
- **Purpose**: Enumerates all symplectic solutions for a system of linear equations by leveraging degrees of freedom in partially constrained matrices.
---
### Algorithm 3: Logical Clifford Synthesis (LCS)
- **Purpose**: Synthesizes all physical realizations of logical Clifford operators for stabilizer codes.
