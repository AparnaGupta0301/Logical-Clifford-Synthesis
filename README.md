## Introduction

The algorithm in this paper reduces the stabilizer matrix of the code into a standard form to determine the logical Pauli operators. For a stabilizer quantum error correcting code, the physical results of applying a Clifford operator on the logical qubits can be represented as a $2m \times 2m$ matrix, reducing the computational complexity from $O(2^m)$ to $O(2m)$. This algorithm assembles all symplectic matrices, of Clifford and of Pauli operators, to realize the unitary logical operator being implemented on the system.
